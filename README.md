**Description -**

Tic Tac Toe 2D Unity Game is a classic two-player board game implemented in Unity. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking their symbol (either "X" or "O") in an attempt to form a line of three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game. If all spaces on the grid are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
